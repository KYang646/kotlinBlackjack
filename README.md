Kimball Yang
Discord: Kimball
USA, New York City
10 months of Swift 4.0

I hope I can master both Swift and Kotlin so that I may be able to teach others these valuable skills as a mobile developer. I'm very committed to helping people from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve class mobility.

My primary hobbies are gaming, music and movies primarily. I also enjoy watching American Football. GO NY JETS! I also have an interest in architecture.
